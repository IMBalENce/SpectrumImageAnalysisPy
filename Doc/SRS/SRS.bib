	abstract = {Energy resolution is one of the most important parameters in electron energy-loss spectroscopy. This is especially true for measurement of surface plasmon resonances, where high-energy resolution is crucial for resolving individual resonance peaks, in particular close to the zero-loss peak. In this work, we improve the energy resolution of electron energy-loss spectra of surface plasmon resonances, acquired with a monochromated beam in a scanning transmission electron microscope, by the use of the Richardson–Lucy deconvolution algorithm. We test the performance of the algorithm in a simulated spectrum and then apply it to experimental energy-loss spectra of a lithographically patterned silver nanorod. By reduction of the point spread function of the spectrum, we are able to identify low-energy surface plasmon peaks in spectra, more localized features, and higher contrast in surface plasmon energy-filtered maps. Thanks to the combination of a monochromated beam and the Richardson–Lucy algorithm, we improve the effective resolution down to 30 meV, and evidence of success up to 10 meV resolution for losses below 1 eV. We also propose, implement, and test two methods to limit the number of iterations in the algorithm. The first method is based on noise measurement and analysis, while in the second we monitor the change of slope in the deconvolved spectrum.},

	abstract = {Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) involves analyzing the energy distribution of initially monoenergetic electrons after they have interacted with a specimen. This interaction is sometimes confined to a few atomic layers, as when a beam of low-energy (100–1000 eV) electrons is “reflected” from a solid surface. Because high voltages are not involved, the apparatus is relatively compact but the low penetration depth implies the use of ultrahigh vacuum. Otherwise information is obtained mainly from the carbonaceous or oxide layers on the specimen’s surface. At these low primary energies, a monochromator can reduce the energy spread of the primary beam to a few millielectron volts (1991) and if the spectrometer has comparable resolution, the spectrum contains features characteristic of energy exchange with the vibrational modes of surface atoms, as well as valence electron excitation in these atoms. The technique is therefore referred to as high-resolution electron energy-loss spectroscopy (HREELS) and is used to study the physics and chemistry of surfaces and of adsorbed atoms or molecules. Although it is an important tool of surface science, HREELS uses concepts that are somewhat different to those involved in electron microscope studies and will not be discussed further in the present volume. The instrumentation, theory, and applications of HREELS are described by Ibach and Mills (1982) and by Kesmodel (2006).},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a numerical method which can routinely improve the energy resolution down to 0.2–0.3 eV of electron energy-loss spectra acquired in a transmission electron microscope. The method involves measurement of the point-spread function (PSF) corresponding to the spectrometer aberration and to the incident energy spread, and then an inversion of this PSF so as to restore the spectrum. The chosen algorithm is based on an iterative calculation of the maximum likelihood solution known to be very robust against small errors in the PSF used. Restorations have been performed on diamond and graphite C-K edges acquired with an initial energy resolution of around 1 eV. After reconstruction, the sharp core exciton lines become clearly visible for both compounds and the final energy resolution is estimated to be about 200–300 meV. In the case of graphite, restorations involving both energy resolution and angular resolution have been successfully conducted. Finally, restorations of Fe L2,3 and O-K edges measured for various iron oxides will be shown.},

This is a 3D array of nxnxs numbers, the first two axes of which correspond to the x − y position on the specimen as for any image, while the third is associated to a complete energy-loss spectrum. New images and spectra can be extracted as sections or projections of this matrix, and their respective aims and advantages will be sketched. Novel types of processing are also evoked. This approach is closely related to the parallel detection units for EELS spectroscopy now available: despite their great size, these spectrum- images can be handled with normal computing technology, and an example of data compression is introduced to illustrate how far problems in storage can be solved.},

	abstract = {This paper argues that the reliability of engineering computation can be significantly improved by adopting software engineering methodologies for requirements analysis and specification. The argument centers around the fact that the only way to judge the reliability of a system is by comparison to a specification of the requirements. This paper also points to methods for documenting the requirements. In particular, a requirements template is proposed for specifying engineering computation software. To make the mathematical specification easily understandable by all stakeholders, the requirements documentation employs the technique of using tabular expressions. To clarify the presentation, this paper includes a case study of the documentation for a system for analyzing statically determinant beams.},
