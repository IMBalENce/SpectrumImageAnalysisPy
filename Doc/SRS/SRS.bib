	abstract = {This paper defines a new concept in EELS digital acquisition and processing: the spectrum-image. This is a 3D array of nxnxs numbers, the first two axes of which correspond to the x − y position on the specimen as for any image, while the third is associated to a complete energy-loss spectrum. New images and spectra can be extracted as sections or projections of this matrix, and their respective aims and advantages will be sketched. Novel types of processing are also evoked. This approach is closely related to the parallel detection units for EELS spectroscopy now available: despite their great size, these spectrum- images can be handled with normal computing technology, and an example of data compression is introduced to illustrate how far problems in storage can be solved.},
