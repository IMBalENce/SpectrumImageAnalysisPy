        \textbf{Terminology} & \textbf{Definitions}\\
        \midrule
        Beam & The probe used by an electron microscope, composed of electrons
        accelerated to high speeds\\
        Beam current & the number of electrons travelling in the beam per unit
        time\\
        Cathodoluminescence & A technique in a STEM or SEM in which light
        emitted from the sample is collected by a mirror and directed to a spectrometer
        or other analysis system\\
        Charge-Coupled Device & The camera used in the spectrometer to collect
        signal and output it to the microscope acquisition software\\
        Electron energy loss spectroscopy & a technique performed in a TEM or STEM
        which detects the energy lost by an electron beam after passing through a
        sample\\
        Image & A 2D dataset with two spatial dimensions, as acquired by a
        camera, the value at each pixel representing the intensity of the signal
        at that spatial location.\\
        Point Spread Function (PSF) & A function representing the spreading in the
        spectrometer, as defined in \ddref{PSF}\\
        Sample & A physical sample of scientific interest that has been probed by
        the beam in the EELS or CL instrument\\
        Scanning transmission electron microscope & A TEM with the capability of
        scanning the electron beam in a raster scan over the sample\\
        Slice & A subset of the dataset\\
        Spectrometer & An instrument attached to a microscope and equipped with a
        CCD or equivalent camera, used for collecting signal as a function of energy\\
        Scanning electron microscope & A microscope which uses an electron beam to
        probe the sample and acquires data based on scattering off the surface or near
        the surface of the sample, operating using a raster scan of the electron beam\\
        Spectrum & A 1D dataset: one axis has the energy (EELS) or wavelength
        (CL), while the other contains the collected intensity of the signal
        corresponding to the energy/wavelength channel.\\
        Spectrum Image & A 3D dataset with two spatial dimensions and one spectral
        dimension, obtained using spectro-microscopy techniques (\textit{i.e.}, EELS or
        CL) (\ddref{SI})\\
        Transmission electron microscope & A microscope which uses an electron
        beam to probe a sample and collects the signal of the transmitted beam.\\
